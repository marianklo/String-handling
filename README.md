# String-handling

Create a Python file replace.py.

● Save the sentence: “The!quick!brown!fox!jumps!over!the!lazy!dog!.” as a
single string.

○ Reprint this sentence as “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy
dog.” using the replace() function to replace every “!” exclamation
mark with a blank space.

○ Reprint that sentence as: “THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER
THE LAZY DOG.” using the upper() function

○ Print the sentence in reverse.
